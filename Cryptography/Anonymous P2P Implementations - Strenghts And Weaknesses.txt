Definitions of abbreviated names:
* TOR means "The Onion Router".
* OFF is the "Owner Free Filesystem", a distributed data store.
* GNUnet is a P2P network specifically designed for file sharing.
* I2P ist the "Invisible Internet" Protocol.

Requirement for Central Servers
* TOR: Although TOR uses Onion-Routing between the central servers and thus, in theory, no-one could track the user's identities, in practice TOR relies on a couple of relatively few, well known anon proxy servers. This is not real P2P - one cannot rule out the possibility that all or most of the servers are subject to fairly complete surveillance coverage, if not actually run by law enforcement agencies themselves. Thus TOR might be good enough for everyday anonymity, but one cannot rule out the possibility that organizations like RIAA with notoriously good government relations might be able to reconstruct the true identity of a node.
* Freenet is true P2P system and does not use any central servers.
* RShare needs central servers named "web caches" only for bootstrapping. Web caches just store the IP addresses and port numbers of nodes. When a node needs peers, it contacts several well-known web caches, tells it its own IP address and contact port, and gets a random selection of other node's IP addresses and contact ports. Web caches are by no means associated with the actual file transfer, which only happens beween peers.
* OFF is actually a distributed hash table and does not need any central servers as such. However, like in Bittorrent, distributing access information to the contents roots is not handled by the filesystem itself and must happen using external means.
* GNUnet is true P2P and therefore does not need any central servers.
* I2P uses a public "netDb" for finding participants to use for onion/garlic routing. This NetDb is a Kademlia distributed hash table and therefore quite secure once it has been "bootstrapped" (i. e. some other peers are known). But in order to bootstrap the system, "a few websites" (read: central servers) of the project publish current node lists. I do not currently know whether this bootstrap process happens only at the first time after a client has been installed, or every time it is started.

End-To-End encryption.
Without end-to-end-encryption, each peer can see the data being transferred through it. Although the peer might not be able to figure out where the data came from or goes through, it could still block or selectively corrupt unwanted contents. That is, peers are free to apply some restricted form of censorship.
On the other hand, end-to-end-encryption cannot add any security to a truly anonymous P2P network anyway, as the author of MUTE explains on his web site. In short, the problem is that secure key exchange will never be possible, because there is no way for two anonymous end-points to securely identify each other. A "man in the middle" peer can therefore always intercept a key exchange, assume the identity of either end, decrypting the data and just forwarding it to the other end re-encrypted.
* MUTE only has point-to-point encryption.
* ANTS P2P has end-to-end encryption.
* OFF does not use any encryption at all, but this should also not be necessary. OFF stores all blocks data as the combination of two pre-existing blocks of data plus an XOR-Block; all three blocks XORed together represent the actual data. Reconstruction is therefore only possible if it is known which blocks to combine, und the individual blocks are useless without knowledge of the other combining blocks. Also the same storage block can take part in different XOR operations for reconstructing different resulting data blocks.
* I2P provides end-to-end encryption based on AES-256 with explicit IV and SHA2-256 for message verification. ElGamal-2048 (which is basically a delayed Diffie-Hellman key exchange) is used for public key cryptography operations. Unfortunately, I2P also uses DSA signatures.

Peer-To-Peer encryption
Anonymizing networks typically encrypt the traffic at least between peers.
* I2P uses AES-256-CBC with explicit IV and HMAC-MD5-128 for integrity checking. The session key is exchanged using 2048 Bit Diffie-Hellman.

Network Model.
* I2P is a packet switched network. Inbound and outbound messages between two endpoints use different routes in order to make correlation between them harder.
* TOR is a circuit switched network. Although encrypted and onion-routed, packets in a bi-directional tunnel take the same route in both directions, a fact which makes traffic analys attacks more likely to succeed.
* In RShare dedicated virtual circuits are established between two peers through a chain of other peers for a transferring a specific file. Communication is encrypted between point to point only, but not end-to-end.
* OFF exchanges data using HTTP and a Webbrowser; each peer has a local web server running for implementing the protocol. Transfer takes place via TCP and in units approximately 128 kbytes in size.

Threat Scenarios.
* The well-known servers hosting the current list of RShare web caches could be seized by an attacker and a fake list could be published which only lists web caches controlled by the attacker. Those fake caches will only give a small set of fake peers to all requesting peers, all of which are under the control of the attacker. Each real peer will then be connected with nothing but fake peers, and all requests made or search requestes replied to by the real peer will therefore be known to have originated from that peer, thus voiding its anonymity.
* P2P Protocols without end-to-end or at least segment-to-segment encryption, like RShare, make it easy for an malicious node to monitor the data flowing through it, possibly corrupting the transferred data selectively or replacing it with fake data.
* RShare dedicated virtual circuits might make it easy for traffic analysis to determine where bait files from a honeypot peer will be transferred to, assuming global data retention by the attacker being effective.
* The OFF network could be floodded by requests to store useless or fake data, consuming all the available space. OFF lacks a feature to eventually delete files that are not popular.
* If the OFF data blocks requested by a client from different OFF nodes are known to recombine to a known illegal content, it could be reasoned that it was the intent of the client to fetch that illegal content. This attack requires monitoring all in/outgoing data from the client, which could easily be done by the client's ISP. This attack is possible only because OFF does not use proxying like Freenet does. In OFF the sender and receiver of each transferred block can freely be observed.
* The uploader of illegal content in OFF can be tracked if all traffic is monitored for that peer and the URL of the content is known. Even though uploaded content will make use of pre-existing data blocks elsewhere, the final XOR blocks must be created by the same peer uploading the content. All the attacker must do is keep a log of all the block ids written by the peer. If the attacker can document that all other blocks required for decoding illegal content already existed within the network before the monitored node wrote the last block required to reconstruct the content, it can be reasoned that this last block must have been the XOR block and not some pre-existing block which has just been reused.
* GNUnet uses well-known ports which could be detected and blocked by an attacker, resulting in a denial of GNUnet service.
* I2P. All an attacker has to do for subverting the system is redirecting traffic to the central bootstrap servers to a fake site and push a fake node list down the requesting peer's throat. In that regard, the system is even less secure than TOR, where a lot of central servers operated by different people are known. On the other hand, if the system is clever enough to request this bootstrap information not at every startup but only when started for the first time, the system is quite safe unless the attacker manages to subvert that initial bootstrapping process quite from the beginning which is rather unlikely.
* The security of I2P depends mostly on the security of AES-256. If there is a backdoor in this algorithm, which is quite possible considering that the NSA wholeheartedly recommends it and some concerns about its "mathematical structure" are well known, then I2P cannot be trusted. But as usually, only time can tell.
* I2P uses DSA signatures. There are known problems with this algorithm which can leak the private key if a weak pseudo-random-generator is used. Also its strength is quite limited to 1024 bits, which is too weak in my opinion. On the other hand, I hope the signatures are only used inside encrypted messages, so the attacker needs to crack the encryption first before he can tamper with the signature. Also, whether a good PRNG is used is up to the implementors of I2P, and therefore at least controllable.
