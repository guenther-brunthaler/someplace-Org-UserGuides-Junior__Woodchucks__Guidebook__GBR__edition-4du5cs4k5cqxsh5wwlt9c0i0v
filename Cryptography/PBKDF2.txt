Password-based key derivation function, version 2

DK = PBKDF2(PRF, P, S, c, dkLen)

PRF(key, bytestring) is a parameter of PBKDF2 - it is a pseudorandom function of two parameters with output length hLen (e.g. keyed HMAC)

P is the master password for which a derivation is generated

S is a salt

c number of iterations, positive integer

dkLen is the length of the derived key

DK is a generated derived key

---

For each hLen-bit block T[i] of derived key DK, computing is as follows:

DK = T[1] concat T[2] concat ... concat T[dklen/hlen]
T[i] = F(P, S, c, i)

F(P, S, c, i) = U[1] xor U[2] xor ... xor U[c]

U[1] = PRF(key := P, S concat uint32be(i))
U[2] = PRF(key := P, U[1])
...
U[c] = PRF(key := P, U[c - 1])

uint32be(x) is the 32 bit big-endian representation of x as 4 octets.
