Blom Features:
* Using a secret K * K matrix with elements modulo some prime number P, a trusted central authority can generate any number of private/public key pairs which are both K-vectors and assign them to different users which wish to communicate with each other securely.
* In order to communicate with each other, two users first exchange their public keys. This information is sufficient then for both users to create a shared key by combining the public key of the other user with one's own private key.
* This calculated shared key will always be the same for a particular pair of users, so it might be a good idea only to exchange random session session keys encrypted with this fixed key.

Blom Advantages:
* The system is secure against foreign MITM-attacks, because a MITM does not have either private key.
* The bit length of the calculated peer exchange key is the integral part of log2(P), and can thus be freely defined by using a prime number of an appropriate size.
* The only mathematical operations required are addition and multiplication modulo P. There is especially no requirement for exponentation of any kind.
* No random numbers need to be created by the users who want to share a secret. However, if the session keys to be exchanged are random numbers anyway, this might be a moot point.
* If the symmetric encryption algorithm which uses the exchanged keys is not susceptible for related ciphertext attacks, there is no requirement for random session keys - the fixed exchanged secret between two users can then directly be used as the encryption key.
* The algorithm is not based on the discrete log problem but only on simple linear algebra. If the discrete log problem should be cracked some day, RSA/DH will become worthless, while Blom will not be directly affected.
* There is little which can go wrong with parameter selection, while RSA and DH require some consideration for choosing those.
* All security is determined by the central authority. The users do not generate their own private keys and cannot therefore create weak or low-entropy keys by accident or malicious intent.
* Blom might be a good choice for a means of secure communication between a smaller group of users which need secure 1-to-1 communication with each other, and where no user can eavesdrop on the communication between other users, and where the central authority wants to be able to eavesdrop all communication. For example, a military operations center might equip (using a guarded courier) each member of a task force of N soldiers with all the public keys and a secret key derived from a secret K * K matrix with K == N + 2. One of the key pairs is assigned to the operations center itself, so that it can securely communicate with each soldier. As K > N, there is no way that the N soldiers can collude to break the cryptosystem. They can securely communicate with each other and the operations center on the field, cannot eavesdrop on communication of other team members, and the operations center can decrypt all communications.

Blom Disadvantages
* Blom is not a key-exchange algorithm in the sense that every time a new key is exchanged. Every time the same pair of users want to communicate, they will end up with exactly the same shared secret. Which means if that secret is ever compromised, all past encrypted sessions which have been recorded can be decrypted. There is no forward security. Even using randomly-generated session keys for the actual communication cannot help, because those keys will be encrypted by the constant Blom-key which the attacker knows in this scenario. This is completely different from Diffie-Hellman, where always a new shared random secret will be exchanged.
* However, a MITM-attack by any malicious other user who owns a key pair issued by the same central authority is easily possible.
* Also, the secret matrix of the central authority can be reconstructed if K of the key pairs are known to the attacker; i.e. all encryption using key pairs created from that matrix will be comprimised.
* In order to eliminate the threat of colluding malicious users cracking the system, K must be larger than the number of users (which get a single key pair each). In addition, the private keys for the users should not be based on pure random numbers, but should rather be part of an MDS (maximum distance separated) code. For instance, bit-parity, reptition code (sender repeats every bit the same non-even number of times) and Reed-Solomon are such codes. This requires to know the maximum supported number of users in advance. More users than this can be added without any limit, but then the threat becomes real.
* The system is therefore not practical for a large number of users because of the lengths of the key vectors. The RSA or DH algorithms only use a fixed size key independent of the number of users. However RSA and DH also require a rather expensive exponentation operation and a separate signature verification step to authenticate the public key of the other user in order to avoid MITM-attacks.
* The central authority needs an encrypted and not only authenticated way to communicate the key pairs to the users, because the private key is sent as well as the public key.
* The central authority does not only authenticate public keys, but has complete control over the whole cryptosystem and can encrypt/decrypt every message. Of course, the central authority might also interpret this as an advantage.
* And as nicely as the example above with the task force and operation center might work: The same effect could have been achieved by equipping each soldier with N + 1 symmetric random keys for direct communication with each other soldier and the command center. And although the command center then needs to store (N + 1) ** 2 keys, this is still less than the size of the K * K matrix it needs to store with Blom.
* The last point means that Blom is pointless for a fixed number of users known in advance, because in this case simple N * N end-to-end keys require less storage space. But if there are more users, the threat of collusion will exist. So Blom is either pointless or insecure unless all users can be fully trusted. In the latter case, however, there is no need for separate user-to-user communications; all users should share the same symmetric key.
* Which leads to the inevitable conclusion: Blom *is* pointless. It is good for nothing which could not also be done without it, and does therefore not really serve any purpose. At least for now. Blom's only hope: If quantum computing might defeat DH and RSA one day, Blom may or may not be one of very few alternatives left.
