Bitcoin (BTC)
-------------

* Based on "proof of work", burning processing power


Monero
------

Monero means "coin" in Esperanto.

Monero is built upon similar ideas as Bitcoin, but uses an obfuscated distributed leger.

Transactions always use one-time-addresses.

Popular for making Bitcoin transactions anonymous by first converting into Monero and later back after a delay.


CoinJoin
--------

Is not a new cryptocurrency but rather a specific style of doing Bitcoin transactions.

Basically, it mixes together different transactions from different people into a shared transaction, making it harder to track the flow of ownership. By cascading multiple such shared transactions, the privacy can be improved.

In other words, CoinJoin is nothing else than Bitcoin with some mixing transactions involved.
