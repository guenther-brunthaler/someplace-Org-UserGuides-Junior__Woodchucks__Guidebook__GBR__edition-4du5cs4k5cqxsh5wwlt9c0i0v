John Conway's Game Of Life
==========================
v2020.155

This is a cellular automata game. The game board consists of a rectangular grid where every cell can either be dead (empty) or alive (visible cell symbol).

The initial board is either manually set-up or random-generated.

Now, for every follow-up generation:

First, the number (0-8) of neighbors for every cell of the last generation is counted. Then every cell of the new generation is determined as follows:

* An cell with 2 or 3 neighbors survives

* An dead/non-existing cell with 3 neighbors is born as a new cell

* A cell with less then 2 neighbors dies of isolation

* A cell with more than 3 neighbors dies of overpopulation
