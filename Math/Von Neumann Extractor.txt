The Von Neumann extractor is a simple algorithm to remove bias from a lower-quality bit random source, resulting in a higher-quality bit random source.

1. Read two bits A and B from the lower-quality input source

2. If A == B back to step 1.

3. Otherwise, emit bit A as the next bit of the higher-quality random output stream. (B is dropped. It would not be random anyway, because it must be the negated value of A.)

4. Repeat this for as many output bits are required by going back to step 1.
