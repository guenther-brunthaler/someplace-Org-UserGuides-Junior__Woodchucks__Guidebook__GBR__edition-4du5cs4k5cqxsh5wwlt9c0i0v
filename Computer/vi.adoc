Most of the features documented here apply to POSIX `vi` in general.

However, some extensions of the popular `ViM` implementation will also be covered. In such cases, this fact will be pointed out.


Filtering line ranges
---------------------

In order to pipe a range of lines into an external command and replace the range with the command's output, use the 'Escape' command "`!`":

----
:1,5!echo hello
----

This would replace the first 5 lines with the single line "`hello`".

Note that the characters "`%`", "`#`" and "`!`" are treated specially and need to be escaped with an "`\`" in order to be interpreted literally.

For instance, an unescaped "`%`" will be replaced by the current filename. Therefore, the current line can be replaced by it with the command

----
:.!printf '\%s\n' '%'
----

In order to replace the visual selection (from the line where `[Ctrl]+[v]` was issued to the current line) for the same thing, use

----
:'<,'>!echo hello
----

instead. However, this sort of address seems to be a ViM extension.

Here is how to convert the visual selection into upper case in ViM:

----
:'<,'>!tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]'
----

Without any address specification, the 'Escape' command just executes the external command with the same standard file descriptors as the editor was invoked. The edited text will not be affected.

As of 2024-02, the BusyBox implementation of `vi` only supports the last variant.
