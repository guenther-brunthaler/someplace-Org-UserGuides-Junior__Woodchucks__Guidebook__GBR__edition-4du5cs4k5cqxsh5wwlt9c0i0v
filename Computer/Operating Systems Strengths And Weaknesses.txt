Operating Systems Strengths And Weaknesses

* Plan 9 From Bell Labs
[ http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=447435 ]: Plan9 sucks, and is a waste of your time [...] One reason for that was the license [...] The user interface is worse than TWM. It's main editor basically requires that you constantly have one hand on the mouse and hunt and peck keys with the other hand, as if it was designed by one of those old computer illiterate people who can't type and clutch the mouse in a death grip the entire time they are in front of the computer [...] When I saw some poor dude post on the 9fans mailing list 18 months later or whatever wondering why Plan 9 wouldn't boot after a clean disk install, I knew it was dead and that all that time was wasted [...] Plan 9 admittedly sucks in many ways. It has limited hardware support, a weird user interface, and no active community [...]

* INFERNO
INFERNO ist the successor of Plan 9 From Bell Labs. But while Plan 9 was written in a C dialect and compiled to native machine code, INFERNO is all written in a language called "Limbo" which shares many of the design principles of JAVA. It also generates platform-neutral byte-code which is interpreted by a virtual machine, named "dis". Therefore, INFERNO also required a "dis" interpreter to run, and there is no such thing as "native code". The problem of INFERNO is its license. While JAVA permits closed-source programs to be written in JAVA without requiring a commercial license, INFERNO only does so if you purchase a commercial license which costs something around € 180. INFERNO can be used freely only if only open-source programs will be run on it. This will be a problem for programmers who create open source projects most of the time, but also have to develop closed-source projects on customer's behalf from time to time.

* Coyotos
Coyotos is the latest descedent of the (conceptual) acestry line of the GNOSIS, KeyKOS, EROS capability-based operating systems. A capability is an unforgable token much like a file handle which bundles a resource and access rights to that resource for whatever process owns an instance of that capability. The goal of Coyotos was to become the first formally verified operating system. However, L4Se eventually obtained that title. But in contrary to L4Se, Coyotos is an open source OS and has been considered as one of the candidates to replace the Mach kernel in GNU HURD (although the HURD maintainers have eventually chosen to stick with Mach as of 2012). Currently (2012) the focus for Coyotos development has been the BitC language which ought to be the basis for implementing and formally verifying Coyotos. It seems this process has not yet been finished, and therefore the implementation of Coyotos itself cannot have been completed either. As an interesting side not, Microsoft hired one of the primary maintainers of Coyotos and development on the project stopped because of this for a couple of years. One might speculate from this that Microsoft classified Coyotos as a threat and wanted to slow down its development process.

* wxworks
Commercial Operating System by Wind River Systems. Targetted at small embedded devices. For instance, LinkSys has replaced Linux with wxworks in more recent models of their routers, allowing to reduce the amount of both required flash memory and RAM by 50 %. (8 MB RAM instead of 16 MB, 2 MB flash instead of 4 MB.) However, a single license for a small team supposedly costs USD 23,000; rumors say single-developer license might be available at USD 3,500. Those numbers were found as of 2012 in arbitrary web pages, it was impossible for me to find any information about license costs on the Wind River web site itself after searching for several minutes. However, if the figures mentioned before should turn out to be correct, it is no wonder they do not want to scare the customers away by providing pricing information unless the customers are already totally committed to buy at any price.

* GNU Hurd
Capability-based OS currently built on the Mach kernel. L4 and Coyotos have also been considered as Mach replacents, but those efforts have been discontinued. (Actuality: 2012.)

* L4
Very lean and minimalistic yet complete Microkernel. The modern and the freely available versions are written in C++. It is almost exclusively being used on embedded systems for single-purpose appliances. It works fine there. However, there is no experience how L4 actually scales to big systems. Although the Linux Kernel has been ported to run within an L4 container, this still is a monolithic system and tells nothing about how well L4 works in a real microkernel system where each device driver is a separate process rather than a single monolithic process implementing all the drivers in one place.

* RISC OS
Original developed for the Acorn Archimedes, later used on several ARM-based computers. A single-user OS with co-operative multitasking (like Windows 3.x). Does not feature preemptive multithreading yet. Incomplete memory protection. Existing file systems and the kernel VFS are restricted to file sizes of 2 GiB. File types are based on metadata rather than file extensions. The ROX desktop for Linux is an attempt to reproduce several of the ideas of the RISC OS GUI for *NIX. In fact, ROX stands for "RISC OS on X". The RISC OS image is rather small (about 4 MiB) and usually stored in flash memory. There is a version of RISC OS available for the Raspberry Pi. RISC OS seems to be a typical "home computer" OS of the 90's, much like AmigaDOS or Atari's TOS. Although there seems still to exist an active user base for the OS, it obviously cannot be very large, and it might be more of a retro thing. In comparison to a modern Linux system, RISC OS seems very restricted. On the other hand, RISC OS is certainly less resource hungry, too. The primary platform for RISC OS nowadays seem to be single board computers such as the BeagleBoard.

* OpenBSD
Theo de Raadt's fork of NetBSD after he was removed from there due to his controversial leadership style. Security is a top priority in OpenBSD and no closed-source drivers are allowed at all. For instance, OpenSSH ist an OpenBSD-project. Code audits are performed regularly, at least for the core system. There is not enough man-power available to audit packages developed by 3rd-parties in the same way. Unfortunately, other than NetBSD, OpenBSD supports only a dozen hardware platforms, and especially not ARM. Raspberry Pi support in particular is not planned, because, as Theo de Raadt puts it, "Dream on. It is a mess of firmware. You know nothing of our history?". OpenBSD is known for the highest-quality documentation among the BSDs, while all BSDs are known for very high documentation standards. In 2014, the project had problems covering its electricity bills and required donations or it would have to shut down. Enough donations came in to secure the short-term future of the project, but its long-term future remains uncertain. OpenBSD is the least frequently used of the 3 most popular BSD variants.

* NetBSD
A source based UNIX distribution available for 57+ hardware platforms based on 15+ CPU architectures. However, this comes at a price, because the kernel uses a hardware abstraction-layer to allow better code reuse between platforms, but this also means more overhead. Also, NetBSD requires an MMU. A special feature is the cross-compiling framework "build.sh", which allows to build the system for a different target architecture from the current one. NetBSD ist the second frequenty used of the 3 most popular BSD variants. A variant for the Raspberry Pi 1 and is available, including GPU and Quake3 support. omxplayer for hardware-accelerated movie playback also works. What does not yet work is multiprocessor support for the Pi 2 and isochronous USB-mode (rarely needed; this mode may drop packets in order to maintain a guaranteed data rate; only for certain realtime applications). Disk-encryption is supported, although as of 2015 only with AES, 3DES or Blowfish. Only CBC is supported and the IV for each disk block is generated by encrypting the block number with the same key as the disk block data.

* FreeBSD
A source based UNIX distribution and a direct descedant of the original BSD, and as such a true flavour of UNIX. NetBSD ist the most frequenty used of the 3 most popular BSD variants (75 % share in 2015) but only supports a handful of hardware platforms. However, those platforms are the most important ones, including x86, ARM and MIPS. Raspberry Pi 1 and 2 are also supported, although not all packages are available there. Apple uses a large part of FreeBSD's source code for their proprietary operating system. The liberal licensing terms of FreeBSD encourage such use. FreeBSD is known for unique features related to storage, including RAID, journaling, full-disk-encryption, caching and network-backed storage. The ZFS filesystem has also been ported to FreeBSD. OpenBSD provides many security-related features such as ACLs, EAs, fine-grained capabilities, mandatory access control, auditing. Jails is a container-virtualization concept similar to LXC under Linux, and bhyve ist a virtualisation technique simular to KVM. However, it is still not a full virtualization and can run only Linux and BSD guests. FreeBSD provides a compatibility layer for running binary Linux applications, a concept simular to WINE on Linux (although emulating Linux rather than Windows). FreeBSD also provides NDIS kernel interfaces, which allows many closed-source Windows-only network drivers to run on FreeBSD also. The FreeBSD-kernel has a monolithic design with loadable drivers, much like Linux.

* CRUX
A source based Linux distribution which thinks it is a good idea to remove all files in /usr/share/doc/*, because "If you need more information about a specific program, other than information found in the man-page, Google usually knows all about it". It supports only x86-64 in its "official ISO images". 2 GiB RAM are the minimum requirement. Even though cross compiling to other architectures could be expected from a source-based distribution, the official handbook does not mention such capabilities and from what I have seen so far I severely doubt that this might be supported. Simplicity is a big goal of CRUX, and the whole handbool indeed fits into a single HTML page. It might be a nice-enough distribution for x86-64, but does not seem to support different hardware platforms at all.

* Funtoo
A source based Linux distribution based on Gentoo Linux. However, it uses an "innovative profile system" of cascading profile layers which obsoletes direct manipulation of Gentoo's USE Flags and core configuration files. Instead, it features different profile types which can be selected and provide the same information. For instance, the "arch" subprofile selects the hardware architecture, whereas the "build" subprofile selects hat Debian calls a branch, that is "current", "stable", "experimental" and so forth. This is a big difference from Gentoo which always provided the most bleeding edge (and frequently unreliable) package versions. Other profile subtypes are "flavor" (e.g. desktop/server) and "mix-ins" (groups of USE flags for further customization). This means there is still much which can be customized, but less than in Gentoo. Which hopefully means the provided USE-flag combinations have been better tested than in Gentoo and work more reliably. Also, Funtoo distributes its copy of the Portage Tree via git rather rsync. Hopefully this will waste less bandwidth for Portage tree upgrades than Gentoo does. Funtoo does not support systemd, but it does provide Gnome 3. Its init system is based on OpenRC (like Gentoo), but there are plans to enhance it and rival systemd in more areas. Funtoo considers its relation with Gentoo as follows: "Funtoo = Gentoo snapshot + goodies." ... "Funtoo should contain all ebuilds in Gentoo that existed at the time of the snapshot, plus drobbins and user community improvements." (D. Robbins is the creator of Funtoo and was the initiator of Gentoo Linux as well.) Funtoo does not use Gentoo's "rolling releases", but rather imports snapshots of Gentoo's Portage tree twice a year which will only be updated in case of severe bugs or security problems. One problem of Funtoo might be hardware support. Only 64-bit x86 and ARM are fully ("grade A") supported. 32-bit x86 are "still" supported as 2nd-class citizens ("grade B"). So is be RISC-V 64-bit. No other hardware-architectures seem to be supported directly. The primary desktop is Gnome, Wayland is not currently (2023) supported yet.

* Chimera Linux
This is a Linux Kernel paired with a non-GNU, BSD-ported Userland. It uses libmusl rather than glibc as its C runtime library. It uses the same package manager as Alpine Linux, but an incompatible version of it. The base system can be bootstrapped from source in a 4-phase process. It remains unclear whether additional packages can also be built as easily from source. The major maintenance tools are written in Python. The Desktop is Gnome. The Chimera Developers seem to be big fans of systemd. They even set out to "improve" it because as they put it "one of the goals in Chimera is to implement the actual useful systemd functionality, but independently and in our own way, without the shortcomings". They also praise "logind" and all of its "seat management" nonsense, and are even working  on a "better" replacement for "elogin". Of course, they are also big fans of D-Bus and Wayland. To put it shortly, Chimera Linux a big happy Poettering party, except for an unmodified original systemd itself.
