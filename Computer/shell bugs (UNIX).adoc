Shell Bugs
==========
v2020.59

Certain shell features should be avoided because commonly installed versions of POSIX shells can't handle them correctly.


HERE-DOC
--------

Never use command substitution within HERE-DOCUMENTs.

At least some versions of `dash` have a bug when running the following script:

----
$ cat bug
cat << EOF1 << EOF2
hidden
EOF1
shown
`echo also shown`
EOF2
----

This fails like this

----
$ dash bug
bug: 1: bug: hidden
: not found
shown
----

at least on:

----
$ dpkg -s dash | grep ^Version:
Version: 0.5.10.2-5
$ uname -mor
4.19.97-v7+ armv7l GNU/Linux
----
