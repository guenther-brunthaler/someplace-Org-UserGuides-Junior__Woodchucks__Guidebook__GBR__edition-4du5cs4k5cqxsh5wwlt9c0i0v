break=top - stop initramfs-processing (drop into a shell) immediately before executing the first script from /scripts/*. Not even the keymap will have been set yet. However, basic setup such as mounting /proc and installing BusyBox symlinks has already been done. "exit" resumes processing.

break
is the same as "break=premount".

break=top
break=modules
break=premount
break=mount
break=mountroot
break=bottom
break=init
spawns a shell in the initramfs image at the chosen phase before actually executing the corresponding scripts or action. The order of phases through which the initramfs-system passes through is the same as the order of possible "break="-values as shown above. Beware that if both "panic" and "break" are present, initramfs will not spawn any shells but reboot instead.

panic=<sec>
sets an timeout on panic, rebooting the machine after that many seconds in case of a panic. This is a documented security feature: It disables the debug shell.

debug
debug=vc
generates lots of output. When specified without an argument, writes a log to /run/initramfs/initramfs.debug. When invoked with an arbitrary argument instead, output is written to console.

BOOTIF
is a mac address in pxelinux format with leading "01-" and "-" as separations. pxelinux passes mac address of network card used to PXE boot on with this bootarg.

boot=local
boot=NFS
affects which initramfs scripts are run, see the "Subdirectories" section under boot scripts.

blacklist=module1,module2
disables load of specific modules.

netconsole
loads netconsole linux modules with the chosen args.

all_generic_ide
loads generic IDE/ATA chipset support on boot.
