Setting up a forwarding IP Gateway
==================================

This is the listing of a mimimalistic gatway, which accepts outbound traffic from network 10.157.0.0/16 and forwards it using the configured routes of the local system.

----
$ iptables -L
Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination

Chain FORWARD (policy DROP)
target     prot opt source               destination
ACCEPT     all  --  10.157.0.0/16        anywhere             ctstate NEW
ACCEPT     all  --  anywhere             anywhere             ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED

Chain OUTPUT (policy ACCEPT)
target     prot opt source               destination
----

In sddition, for every network interface which shall make use of the above forwarding rules, it needs to be enabled in sysctl:

----
net.ipv4.conf.ethlan.forwarding = 1
net.ipv4.conf.ppp0.forwarding = 1
----

would enable interfaces ppp0 and ethlan to take part in the forwarding process.

The forwarding is bi-directional due to reply packets, and therefore both incoming and outgoing interfaces need forwarding to be enabled.
