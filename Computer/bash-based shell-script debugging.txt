Bash has a couple of useful extensions.

While they should never be used in a shell script for portability reasons, it's ok to use them in interactive shells.

The following is useful for debugging scripts:

$ PS4=$'# $? ${FUNCNAME[*]}\n{$LINENO} ' bash -xv $script $arguments ...

This will prefix all lines logged by -x with a comment line, and will prefix the executed lines themselves with their line number between curly braces.

The comment line shows the return code of the last command (0 means OK) followed by a stack trace of the executing shell function.

Also note that bash interprets the first "-" argument quite similar like POSIX tools interpret "--", i. e. it ignores it but stops looking for options at this point. This is useful to change the "-xy" into "-" for temporarily disable debugging. This makes it easy to re-add the "xv" later for resuming debugging without changing anything else in the command line.

If ANSI colors are available in a terminal with black background, the following command can instead be used for a colored debug log:

$ PS4=$'\e[32m#\e[41;37m${?#0}\e[0;32m ${FUNCNAME[*]}\n\e[33m{$LINENO} \e[0m' bash -xv $script $arguments ... 2>& 1 | less -R

The -R is necessary or the color codes will not be displayed properly by "less".
