qalc

v2020.150

`qalc` is the command-line utility shipped with the 'Qalculate!' GUI desktop calculator.

Typical usages:

----
$ qalc -t -set 'max_decimals 2' '5000 + 20 %'
$ qalc -t -set 'exact 1' -set 'min_decimals 2' '5000 / 13 %'
----

where the "`-t`" suppresses showing the interpreted input (typically a repetition) in the output.

----
$ qalc -set 'base 16' -set 'precision 30' 256/3
----

Some properties to "`-set`"

* +min_decimals *N*+
* +max_decimals *N*+
* +fractions 1+
* +exact 1+
* +precision *N*+
* +base *N*+

Some functions/features to use in the expression to be evaluated:

----
add(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) = sum(element([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], "i"), 1, 5, "i")
multiply(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) = 5!; 5! = factorial(5)
cos(pi); 4*atan(1)
log(e); log(2^8, 2)
integrate(expr, var); diff(expr, var)
----

Some predefined special variables:
----
Yesterday; Tomorrow; Today; Now
----

Convert result of all expressions to units, sharing the same single conversion specification:
----
40 MtTNT to kcal
2 ^ 64 bytes to exbibytes
lightyear / c to mixed
----

Variables `x`, `y` and `z` are recognized directly as such. Other variable names have to be wrapped within double quotes or they might get mismatched with unit name abbreviations (an unquoted name `a` would be interpreted as 'Ampere').

----
$ LANG=en_US.UTF-8 LANGUAGE= qalculate &

then insert some function using the menus, and see how it was named.
