* RAII: The "Resource Acquisition Is Initialization" pattern can be used for resource-management in object-oriented systems. Resource lifetime is bound to object lifetimes. The constructor of a resource objects creates and initializes it. The destructor shuts it down (if necessary) and releases it.

* Dispose pattern: This is the classical "manual deallocation" scheme, i. e. fopen/fclose, malloc/free. However, the term is normally only used in languages which provide garbage collection and automatic resource deallocation when the application ends. The pattern is used there to release resources immediately, without a need to wait for (or prematurely trigger) execution of delayed cleanup functions, such as destructors invoked only eventually by garbage collection. The "early exit" problem of this pattern is that abnormal program behaviour may bypass the manually-called deallocation function. Frequently a "finally"-construct is used to avoid this.

* Observer pattern: An object maintains a list of other objects which are interested in changes of the beforementioned object's state, and notifies them automatically when its state changes. This pattern is used by nearly all GUI toolkits. Interested objects must normally "register" with the object they are interested in, and de-register once they lose interest. Notifications are typically sent using (framework-level) "signals", message broadcasts or just by invoking callback methods on each registered object. The pattern can lead to resource leaks if strong references are created by registration, because those references can keep the original objects alive even if the are not needed anywhere else. As a countermeasure, weak references can be used instead. The observer pattern is also used as part of the model-controller-view pattern.

* MVC: The model-view-controller pattern for implementing user interfaces (typically GUIs, but it can also be used in web applications). The user sees a "view" and uses "controllers". Controllers manipulate the "model". The Model updates the Views. Models are objects containing data and application logic. They are the "actual program" stripped of the actual user interaction. The Views hold the output of the "model" and present it to the user somehow. The controllers are the means of the user to edit and enter data, which is routed as input to the "model". MVC usually uses the "observer pattern" to implement controllers and views, and frequently also the model. In client-server applications, all components of the model can live on the server, while the client just displays rendered web pages and sends new inputs using HTML forms to the server. "Web 2.0" applications, however, frequently implement controllers and views (at least partially) locally on the client in JavaScript, and the server only implements the model.

* Strangler Fig pattern: The Strangler Fig pattern aims to incrementally re-write small parts of your codebase, until after a few months/years, you have strangled all your old codebase and it can be totally removed. The rough flow is: add a new part to your system that isn't used yet, switch on the new part of the code – normally with a feature flag so it coexists with the old code – and finally remove the old code.
