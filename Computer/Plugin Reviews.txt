_application/plugin-version: {similarity_group_1}{similarity_group_2}{similarity_group_3} Description. Syntax of the lines in this file. The {similarity_groups} are optional. "_application" is the name of the tool or application for which "plugin" is an available plug-in. Try not to use distribution-specific package names for "_application", but rather use the name used in the tool's documentation or web site to refer to itself. There must not be Slashes in the name. If there are, substitute them with "%2f", and substitute a literal "%" with "%25". "version" is the version identifier of the plug-in the review has been written (or updated) for. If upstream does not use version identifiers, an artificial version identifier should be synthesized which contains at least the approximate date of the version, plus an upstream revision identifier sufficient for retrieving this specific version if possible. For instance, "201203_svn7883" might be used to specify the approximate date 2012-03 as well as the Subversion revision number 7883. Avoid dashes in version identifiers if possible. Colons must not be used in version identifier, replace them by "%3a" and literal "%" by "%25". Each package can be tagged with an arbitrary number of {similarity_group} identifiers. Assigning the same identifier to multiple packages created logical groups. For instance, {text-editor} might be assigned to all text editor packages, console-based ones also get tagged with {text-mode}, while X11 GUI-based ones might be tagged with {x11}. However, it might be better to use more specific tags, because this makes less packages match, so a text search for a tag finds less but more appropriate results.
Bazaar-NG/loom-201307: This is a patch queue manager which version-controls the patches. I do not see any point in using this tool: More powerfol tools like quilt are also available and to a better job. It is also not a problem to put the patches and series file maintained by quilt under version control as normal files. Also, loom does not seem to provide any outstanding features quilt does not have. And even worse, loom does not use normal bzr branches but rather uses its own format. Which means those branches cannot be used without the plugin. Loom may be of some use on other platforms where quilt, being a set of UNIX shell scripts, does not work as nicely as it does under Linux.
Bazaar-NG/pipeline-1.4.0: Another patch queue manager for bzr. Mostly the same caveats apply as for loom. However, pipeline is somewhat less problematic because it uses normal bzr branches and does require a custom metadata format. It is also differently organized, because in pipeline each patch becomes its own bzr branch - the plugin just creates a layer over the underlying "patch" branches, treating them as sub-ordinate patches as part of a pipeline branch. From what I can see, pipeline has no real advantages compared to quilt either; the same comments regarding its pointlessness as for loom apply here es well. It could be considered an advantage that "quilt add" or "quilt edit" is not necessary by patch queue manager plugins. But then, its easy to set up a shell alias for your preferred editor, invoking "quilt edit" instead of the editor directly.
