$ command -v reportbug > /dev/null 2>&1 || sudo apt-get install reportbug
$ reportbug -O -p

This prompts for necessary details like the package name, and displays a preliminary bug report to standard output.

However, a copy of that text is also saved as /tmp/reportbug-* which can then be copied into a new mail.

The output also contains the intended mail headers (the first block if non-empty lines), which should NOT be copied into the mail body of the actual mail to be sent.

However, the header fields generated by the MUA should be as close as possible to to those shown in the file.

The shown mail headers will also include custom header fields, especially "X-Debbugs-Cc", which is not normally supported by MUAs.

In Mozilla Thunderbird, such a field can be added by opening the advanced configuration editor and setting the "mail.compose.other.header" key to the value "X-Debbugs-Cc". (It is also possible to specify multiple additional fields by separating the field names with commas.)

Before actually sending the copied mail body, it should be completed by replacing the template lines between the "***"-markers with suitable contents.
