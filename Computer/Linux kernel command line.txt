man bootparam
For "m": modprobe usbcore blinkenlights=1
For "y": usbcore.blinkenlights=1
[KNL] Is a kernel start-up parameter.
[BOOT] Is a boot loader parameter.
A trailing = on the name of any parameter states that that parameter will
be entered as an environment variable, whereas its absence indicates that
it will appear as a kernel argument readable via /proc/cmdline.
