`chroot` jail containers
========================

If you quickly want to set up a `chroot` environment for a command, use the following of my scripts like shown below.

Let's say you wanted `/bin/sh` and `/bin/ls` in the chroot jail:

----
mkdir rootjail
chroot-jail-populate rootjail /bin/sh /bin/ls
----

Alternatively, you could also have `chdir`ed into the "`rootjail`" directory and specified "`.`" as the first argument to the script.
