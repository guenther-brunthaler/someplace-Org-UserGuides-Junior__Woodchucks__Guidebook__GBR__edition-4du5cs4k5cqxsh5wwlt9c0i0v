As a preprocessing step in conversion into paragraph-based flow text, leading and
trailing whitespace of all lines will be stripped.

All paragraphs are delimited by single emtpy lines. All lines of a paragraph
will be converted into a single line by joining the individual lines with a
single space. However, there is an exception for the first paragraph of each
article: Its lines (representing parts of an URL) will be joined without any seprator.

The document consists of a sequence or articles.

The first paragraph must always contain the URL.

The second one contains either a date followed by a comma or just a date.

In the first case, it represents a normal article.

In the second case, it represents an article about security-relevant themes
which is intended to end up in a different file after conversion.

After those two initial lines, the Article text follows as a series of
paragraphes, usually but not necessarily starting with a headline as the first
paragraph.

Paragraphs entirely consisting of a single character are transformed into
"...".

Paragraphs entriely consisting of "..." (after applying the above
transformation) will join the paragraphes before and after them into a single
paragraph and use " [...] " as a separator. If this construct is the first or
last paragraph in the article, the leading or trailing space of this separator
is omitted in order to avoid the transformed article starting or ending with a space.

The end of an article ist identified by "+++" as a separate paragraph. It is
always required, i. e. the file should and with such a line.

The last paragraph of a file does not need to be terminated by an empty line;
EOF serves the same purpose.
