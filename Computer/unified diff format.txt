===EXCLUDED_END_OF_FILE===

The first two lines only specify the old ("---") and new ("+++") files and associated timestamps.

A block of additional lines is allowed before the ("---") line and must not contain an empty line. Some tools evaluate some of those lines.

Before this block of additional lines, an empty line is allowed, prefixed by a comment as an arbitrary number of lines which will be ignored by "patch".

The @@ lines start sections containing changes. The format is

@@ -<first_old_line>,<line_count> +<first_new_line>,<line_count> @@

<first_old_line> and <first_old_line> are the 1-based line numbers within the old and new files where the block of changes starts.

<line_count> is the number of lines contained in the changes block of the old/new file.

Also, ",<line_count>" can be omitted and defaults to ",1".

The <line> count for the old file consists of the "-"-prefixed and " "-prefixed lines of the patch chunk.

The <line> count for the new file consists of the "+"-prefixed and " "-prefixed lines of the patch chunk.

If a chunk is followed by anything other than another "@@"-line, this marks the end of the current patch.

"patch" then restarts searching for another "---"-line, which would start the next patch within the same file if found. A patch file can contain therefore contain multiple patches.

If there is trailing garbage after the last patch in a patch file, "patch" may display a warning message.
