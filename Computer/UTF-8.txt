UTF-8 encodes full 21-bit UNICODE characters into variable-length (1 to 4) octet sequences as follows:

0xxxxxxx
110xxxxx 10xxxxxx
1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx

Only continuation octets may start with a bit-pattern of '10'.

The first octet of the encoding encodes the number of octets in the current encoding. (Which is the same as the number of leading '1'-bits in the first octet, except for the 1-octet case.)

The above encoding variants by usage:

1 octet:: 7 bit - identical to the ASCII character set

2 octets:: 11 bit - remaining characters including combining marks for most languages besides CJK

3 octets:: 16 bit (Basic Multilingual Plane, BMP) - most of CJK languages

4 octets:: 21 bit - rarely used CJK characters and other exotic characters

Not UTF-8 at all, but rather an extension/extrapolation:

111110xx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
1111110x 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
11111110 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx

5 octets:: 26 bit - can store any 24-bit number, plus 2 bit more

6 octets:: 31 bit - can store full UCS4

7 octets:: 36 bit - can store any 32-bit number, plus 4 bit more
