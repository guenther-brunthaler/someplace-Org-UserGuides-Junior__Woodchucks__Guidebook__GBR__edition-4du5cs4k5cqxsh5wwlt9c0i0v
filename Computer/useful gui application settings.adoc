GTK+ File Chooser Dialog
========================

The `StartupMode` setting in the `gtkfilechooser.ini` file determines which directory is shown when the GTK+ file chooser dialog appears. There are two known choices:

* `recent`: Show the same directory as last time. This is the initial preset.
* `cwd`: Show the current directory of the GUI application which invoked the file chooser

For many users, `cwd` turns out to be a better choice than `recent`. Use the following commands to switch the setting to `cwd`:

----
$ mode=cwd
$ #mode=recent
$ sed -i 's/^\(StartupMode=\).*/\1'"${mode?:}/" ~/.config/gtk-2.0/gtkfilechooser.ini
----

By un-commenting the commented-out command, the initial `recent` preset can be restored.
