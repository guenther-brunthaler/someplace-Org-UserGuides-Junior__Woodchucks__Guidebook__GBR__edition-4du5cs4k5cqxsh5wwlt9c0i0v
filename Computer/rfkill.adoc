Doing rfkill manually on Linux
==============================
v2020.96

This guide helps you to perform the same function as the `rfkill` command on the Linux operating system in the case no such command is installed.

This is helpful if network access for installing the missing `rfkill` command is not possible before `rfkill` unblocks  Wi-Fi.


Get list of wireless interfaces
-------------------------------

Display a list of available wireless devices supporting rfkill:

----
$ ls -1d /sys/class/net/*/*802*11/rfkill* | cut -d / -f 5
----


rfkill list
-----------

Set `$IFC` to one of the devices output by the above command, like `wlan0` in the example below.

The command will then display `1` if the device is currently blocked from using its radio transceiver, or `0` if it is not blocked.

----
$ IFC=wlan0
$ cat /sys/class/rfkill/`ls -1d /sys/class/net/$IFC/*802*11/rfkill* | cut -d / -f 7`/soft
----

rfkill unblock
--------------

Same as for the "rfkill list" section, except that "`cat`" must be replaced with "`echo 0 >`".


rfkill block
------------

Same as for the "rfkill list" section, except that "`cat`" must be replaced with "`echo 1 >`".
