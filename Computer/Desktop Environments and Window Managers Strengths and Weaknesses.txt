KDE Pro:
* Versions up to 3.x had a beautiful look and feel.
* Versions up to 3.x had rich functionality.
* Versions up to 3.x had few bugs and were quite stable.
* Easy way to edit the start menu. Adding new entries to it is also as easy.
* Powerful mechanisms and versatile layout options for user-defined additional Panels.
* Multiple Rows of entries are supported in a single horizontal panel. This eliminates the requirement of stacking multiple single horizontal panels in case a single panel does not provide enough display space.
* KDE 4.11: The Trashcan allows to set a maximum size after which either a waring is displayed, or the largest or olders files are automatically removed to reduce trashcan size. It is also possible to set a maximum age in days.
* KDE 4.11: ksysguard is a very capable system process viewer and the KDE counterpart of GNOME's gnome-system-monitor. Although not overly configurable and presenting a rather simple interface, it displays much additional information by tool tips. It can also examine a processe's memory layout to great detail, i. e. as a highl-level interface for information resources such as /proc/self/maps. And it manages to do so without presenting a complex interface to the user.

KDE Contra:
* Version 4.3 is ugly as hell.
* Version 4.3 has reduced functionality compared to 3.5. Many features are either crippled, completely missing or just don't work. The Amarok version for KDE4.3 ist a prime example for this. Its features and functionality have been crippled to a point rendering the whole application unusable. I switched to the console-based "cmus" which provides better functionality.
* Version 4.3 has countless bugs and is quite unstable. Every couple of hours some DTE component crashes when used intensively.
* KDE 4.11: The panel  does not support dragging configured Applets between multiple existing Panels. Xfce4 supports this.
* KDE 4.11: The clock panel applet does not allow customized date representation formats. Only the long or short forms can be selected. They can be redefined, but that would effect other applications too. It is therefore not possible to display the current date only as day of week and day of month. Xfce4 supports this.
* KDE 4.11: There is still no support for installing arbitrary application launchers in user-Defined pulldown-menu-buttons used as panel buttons. Xfce4 supports this.
* KDE 4.11: The Thrashcan cannot be bypassed for deleting files.
* KDE 4.11: ksysguard can display performance graphs too, but the graphs generated by gnome-system-monitor are somewhat better looking (they look cleaner and scroll more smoothly). ksysguard is missing gnome-system-monitor's file system view. gnome-system-monitor is also better at showing dependency graphs and provides more configurable fields to display.

GNOME Pro:
* GNOME 2.8 looks better than KDE 4.
* Can stack multiple horizontal panels.

GNOME Contra:
* GNOME 2.8 looks worse than KDE 3.
* No support for horizontal panels with multiple rows of entries.
* The idiotic automount options ("flush") for Flash media which cannot (easily) be customized and reduce the life-expectancy of the media.

LXDE Features:
* Uses Openbox as the actual window manager, but adds its own panel (lxpanel), menu creation/update tools, file manager (pcmanfm), archive manager (xarchive) etc.

LXDE Pro:
* Very lean, yet looks complete.
* Little if any dependencies between the various components.
* Small memory footprint.

LXDE Contra:
* Annoying bugs (i. e. additional user-defined panels vanish easily after the "Show Desktop"-button is used - only a restart of the panel application will bring them back). The "Minimize All Application Windows"-Button in the Menu bar also does not work properly when additional user-defined applications are defined in lxpanel.
* If HAL integration is enabled, the same idiotic Flash-media mount options as with GNOME.
* Some versions of pcmanfm use gfvs for volume monitoring and mount every volume they can mount. This includes fstab-Entries which are clearly marked as "noauto". But pcmanfm does not care. This is a new "feature", older versions of pcmanfm did not have this annoying quality.
* Some other versions of pcmanfm use the gamin file alteration monitor for watching which directories/files have changed. But gamin is buggy like hell and likes to hang eating up 100 % CPU after a while.

IceWM Features:
* Rootjail full installation size (amd64, with all libraries including libc): 9,3 MB.
* Language: C++.

IceWM Pro:
* Has a very "Windows-like" default configuration. People accustomed to Microsoft Windows will have little difficulty working with this WM right out of the box even without customizing anything. That is, IceWM has useful defaults. The only problem may be how to create the menu contents, but there are GUI editors available for this.
* Very stable.
* Built-in CPU load and network activity monitor in addition to the usual panel clock.
* Themeable.
* Many options.
* Powerful Window List Features. First, it has the usual window list bar where the Windows of the current desktop are displayed and can be clicked upon directly. Next, it has a "window list"-menu, where all windows of the current workspace can be selected directly and submenus with more window lists are available for the remaining workspaces. The window list menu can usually can display more windows thatn the bar, because the entries are stapled vertically. However, if the menu should also happen to have too many entries, automatic scrolling of menu entries occurs. Finally, there is a separate entry "window list" within the menu, and if this is selected a dedicated window with a horizontal scroll bar pops up which can easily handle very large numbers of entries, and shows all windows grouped by workspace.
* In addition to the usual "minimize", "maximize", "restore", "resize", "shade" and "unshade" options, IceWM provides an additional option "hide". This removes the window from the display and tray bar entirely - it can only be redisplayed via the context menu of its entry in the window list menus. Useful for demon-like GUI programs which are normally intended to run in the background only but still display a window for basic control and occasional configuration.

IceWM Contra:
* Although lean compared to a real DTE, still fatter than several other Window managers.
* Too many useless options no-one is likely to ever need; leading to overly long default configuration files.
* Some of the most interesting options (such as those regarding "focus stealing") do not work as described (or at all).
* Several options do not work properly or are severely restricted when the Theme engine is used. (For instance, selection tolerance settings for grabbing windows edges might be ignored).
* Workspaces can only be configured statically, i. e. via the config files. There is no support for dynamically adding or removing workspaces on a as-needed basis.

twm Features:
* Rootjail full installation size (amd64, with all libraries including libc): 3,9 MB.

twm Pro:
* The simplest and smallest Window Manager in the default configuration (but see jwm).
* With a lot of manual changes to the default options, it can actually be used for real work.

twm Contra:
* No support for the ubiquitous "Alt-Tab"-metaphor for switching application windows.
* Without a lot of manual changes to the default configuration, it is just unusable for real work. And even then, it's not really fun using it.

mwm Pro:
* The simplest Window Manager after twm with small resource requirements.
* The simplest Window Manager providing the "Alt-Tab"-Methaphor for switching application windows.

mwm Contra:
* It depends on the OpenMotif tooklit - a really ugly user interface from the dawn of X11.
* Although it is small, jwm still beats it in size. And jwm is also better.

jwm Features:
* Rootjail full installation size (amd64, with all libraries including libc): 5,7 MB.

jwm Pro:
* The smallest Window Manager when used in its minimal build configuration.
* When built with all features enabled, still among the WMs with the smallest installation space reqirements. Much smaller than for instance IceWM, which has a rather small installation footprint itself.
* Little external dependencies.
* Despite its small size, still features most features one expects from a typical desktop interface, such as multiple workspaces, application launch menu, taskbar, traybar with clock. The "Alt-Tab"-Metaphor is also supported to some extent.
* Allows to "swallow" any (or at least many) X11-Programm into its traybar. This allows otherwise unrelated programs such as xload to nicely integrate into the traybar.

jwm Contra:
* Even though the "Alt-Tab"-Metaphor ist basically supported by jwm, it does not provide a preview of the Window to which will be switched. Instead, the window is switched to immediately. This makes jwm somewhat less comfortable to use in situations where many application windows are open at the same time.
* Does not have an integrated CPU load monitor by default. However, it can integrate xload into its traybar to provide this functionality.

Enlightenment Pro:
* It's smaller than KDE or GNOME.

Enlightenment Contra:
* There is unused space at the sides of the panels which cannot be automatically filled to the edges of the screen.

Openbox Features:
* Rootjail full installation size (amd64, with all libraries including libc): 9,4 MB. (Version 3.4: 27 MB.)
* Rootjail full installation size together with "fbpanel" (amd64, with all libraries including libc): 17 MB. (Version 3.4 and tint2 instead of fbpanel: 45 MB.)
* Language: C.
* Based on Blackbox, but is a complete rewrite.

Openbox Pro:
* OpenBox provides many of the features of IceWM, but has a smaller installation size and also a simpler configuration file with less options.
* Its "launch menu" can dynamically generate entries by running user-provided scripts. That is, it is not necessary (yet possible) to (re-) generate static menus prior to displaying them.
* In addition to a configurable fixed amount of workspaces, additional workspaces can be added (or removed) dynamically via the context menu at any time.
* Although Openbox does not provide any sort of toolbar or traybar, there is an external application "fbpanel" which can be used to provide both. fbpanel also supports OpenBox's capability of dynamically creating/removing additional desktops. In addition to fbpanel, LXDE's lxpanel can also be used (although lxpanel has some annoying bugs and weaknesses). And finally I recommend tint2 (27 MB), which shared most runtime libraries with openbox3 and therefore adds only small installation size overhead compared with other panels. However, tint2 only provides minimal features: A panel with the "task list" and a watch and a traybar area. No "start menu", although this is not a problem since openbox3 itself provides one. No custom buttons or menus. Not even a context menu for the task list. However, it's small and stable and does not replicate half of the functionality of openbox3, like many other panels do.
* Openbox supports more desktop-standards (EWMH standards) than most (all?) the other "small" WMs do. Which means, it interoperates better with a larger number of desktop-integrating applications.
* Openbox is said to have the best theme engine among the small WMs, although it does *not* provide bitmapped themes. I don't know how this matches, but people who have actually created themes say in Openbox it has been the most fun.
* At least newer versions of Openbox provide edge resistance rather than snapping when the user arranges windows manualle. I consider this to be the superior approach and despise snapping.
* The "move" and "resize" options of the window menu are interactive: Instead of needing to held pressed down a mouse button while performing those actions, it is enough to just move the mouse and press the left button when one is done. This way of window manipulation is much less stressier than having to click on an edge or corner precisely and then hold the button pressed down, especially if the mouse button does not work as well as it once did and exposes bouncing of conduct.

OpenBox Contra:
* Openbox does not have any sort of built-in traybar or toolbar panel. All its menus must be accessed via mouse or keyboard buttons; typically by clicking on a free area on the desktop. Space around the borders can be reserved for this, but it looks strange if most of the desktop is filled with windows and an otherwise empty stripe along some border isn't.
* There is no built-in pager or task list window, too. The functionality of both can be approximated by using the menus, but this is not as easy as just clicking on a toolbar.
* The Alt-Tab Methaphor is supported, but as no task list window is available, one has generally no idea what other windows might be available *before* pressing Alt-Tab. (This seems no longer to be true in openbox 3.4, where a preview window does appear.)
* Although it does not depend on GTK+ itself, it does depend on several libraries which are part of the GTK+ distribution (pango, glib, gobject) which add about 2 MB to the total installation size. This can be a show-stopper for a minimalistic X11 installation.
* Although "fbpanel" can be installed together with Openbox in order to add the missing features like panels, start menu and traybar to it, this comes at a price: The rootjail full installation size of "fbpanel" (amd64, with all libraries including libc) is about 15 MB. (Openbox 3.4: 45 MB.) This is because fbpanel requires GTK+, although Openbox itself doesn't. Even though openbox and fbpanel share many DLLs, the combined installation size is still 17 MB which is pretty fat compared to IceWM's 10 MB. On the plus side, many other applications require GTK+ as well, so the 14 MB of GTK+ overhead will normally not be wasted. But then, if you can avoid GTK+ and use simpler applications instead, the GTK+ overhead *does* count in an installation tuned towards minimum installation size.

Fluxbox Features:
* Rootjail full installation size (amd64, with all libraries including libc): 7,8 MB.
* Based on blackbox; mostly an enhancement.
* Language: C++.
* Allows "window tabbing". This looks like normal Tabs in any application supporting tabs, such as a web-browser. However, Fluxbox allows to combine any number of totally unrelated windows into a single window, where the originally separate windows can be selected as individual tabs of the merged window. It is also possible to remove tabs, making them separate windows again.

Fluxbox Contra:
* The only way to resize a window using the mouse only is to grab the handles at the left and right lower corners. It is not possible to grab at a window border for this purpose.
* Only supports snapping and not edge resistance when aligning window borders side by side.
* There is no way to effectively protect against unexpected focus change when a new window opens. One false keystroke, and the new windows might do something unpleasant even though that keystroke was never intended for that window.
* Too few alignment zones for manual window arrangement. There are some situations where the window border does not snap towards a nearby window even though one whishes it would.
* Resizing operations do not snap at all.
* Internal menus like the "Toolbar"-Menu pop up under too many circumstances and it is not possible to disable this unless also disabling user-defined menus under the same circumstances.

Blackbox Features:
* Rootjail full installation size (amd64, with all libraries including libc): 6,6 MB.

dwm Features:
* dwm seems to be derived from the "awesome" WM (or is it the other way around?), sharing most concepts with it.
* dwm  is a dynamic window manager for X. It manages windows in tiled, monocycle and floating layouts. Either layout can be applied dynamically, optimizing the environment for the application in use and the task performed.
* In tiled layouts  windows  are managed in a master and stacking area. The master area contains the window which currently needs most attention, whereas the  stacking  area contains  all  other windows.
* In monocycle layout all windows are maximised to the screen size.
* In floating layout windows can be resized and moved freely.
* Dialog  windows  are always managed floating, regardless of the layout applied.
* Windows are  grouped  by tags. Each  window can be tagged with one or multiple tags. Selecting certain tags displays all windows with these tags.

dwm Pro:
* Primarily keyboard driven, although the mouse can also be used for some tasks.
* In comparison to "awesome", only "dwm" provides "monocycle" layout.
* In its default configuration, "dwm" can be used with a standard keyboard whereas "awesome" assumes a keyboard with "Windows" keys.
* There is only a small traybar at the top of the screen. And even this can be hidden, assigning 100 % of the screen space to the running applications.
* dwm is intended to be used in tandem with a menu application named "dmenu" in order to feature application launcher functionality. "dmenu" is designed to support a very large number (tens of thousands) of menu entries without noticeable degradation of performance.
* dwn has a smaller installation size (about 350 KB) than even "jwm" (at least for a fully configured jwm).

dwm Contra:
* Very peculiar and non-standard user interface paradigm.
* About two dozen or so of keyboard/mouse sequences/combinations need to be remembered in order to master this WM for practical usage. This is not user-friendly for casual users, although it is certainly tolerable for determined power-users.
* No configuaration file, although configuration is possible by modifying a header file and recompiling. However, this prevents multiple users with different configurations from sharing the same executable. It also means that an executable installed by the administrator cannot be customized by the users, because the will typically lack write permission to modify and/or replace that executable. "awesome", in comparison, *does* support a configuration file.
* At least the default configuration, many keyboard-sequences required to control the WM are combinations of Mod1 (i. e. the "Alt" key) and normal letter/digit keys, some combined with "Shift". These are pretty normal keyboard sequences used by the applications as well, especially as menu shortcuts, which might create problems for conflicting uses assigned to the same keyboard sequence by the WM as well as some application. The only clean way to do this would be to use a different Modifier key, but it can be hard to find different modifier keys provided by most platforms which are not already in use. For many Notebook/Desktop PC keyboard layouts the "Windows" keys might be used for this, but a "classical" keyboard layout as found on most terminal devices will not provide such keys.
* The default keyboard navigation keys use the "vi"-movement keys rather than the cursor keys to navigate to the different windows in the same view (i. e. tag group). While this might please some hardcore UNIX freaks a lot, any normal user accustomed to a modern GUI will flee in horror.
* The tiling does not work well with popular application such as Mozilla Firefox. For those. special settings have to be hardcoded into the configuration. This is not very versatile, and it also introduces "special behavior" of the WM for those applications.
* The "dmenu" application launcher intended to be invoked by "dwm" is not actual a part of "dwm" or especially tied to it in any way. Also, "dmenu" looks more like a command line with name completion rather than what a casual user considers to be a "menu". It is certainly not a popup-menu but shares the same screen place like "dwm"s traybar.
* Without the help of "dmenu", "dwm" cannot launch any external commands, except two hardcoded applications (by default, the "uxterm" terminal emulator and the beforementioned "dmenu" application launcher).
* Event though dwm has a smaller installation size than jwm, dwm cannot even launch applications without the help of an external utitily such as "dmenu", which adds another 300 KB to the installation size. Together, those installation sizes already exceed that of jwm, which provides the functionality of both and in addition provides a customizable popup-menu rather than just a command-line like "menu launcher".
* The dwm companion application "dmenu" is as complicated to configure as any any normal application launcher, but does not provide the same amount of user feedback as most users are accustomed to. It neither provides a popup menu, nor represents its "command-line-like" user interface really the power of a command line: It can only be used to select among a predefined set of choices, and does not search the directories in the PATH environment variable like other similar launchers do. On the plus side, when launched from "dwm" it does provide such a functionality; obviously hardcoded within "dwm".
* When switching beween the "floating" and other layouts, the sizes and positions of windows from the "floating" state is forgotten. Clearly, dwm considers the "floating" layout only to be used for temporary operations, not for long-term usage. At least not within the same tag group. Different tag groups can use different layouts, so it is possible to create tag groups which only use the floating layout, thus never forgetting the sizes and positions.
* Floating layout allows free positioning and resizing of windows. However, there is no support for "snapping" or otherwise aligning size and position relative to the other floating windows.
* Due to its limitations, "dwm" can hardly be recommended for a fully-featured desktop system with multiple users. On the other hand, it has only a marginally smaller installation size compared to "awesome". Choosing "dwm" over awesome only makes sense in the smallest of system configurations where only a single among all all available users will actually be using dwm. This seems to be a very unlikely scenario.

awesome Features:
* awesome is very similar to dwm, sharing most concepts. It seems, dwm might be derived from awesome, although it seems perfectly possible it this has actually be done the other way around.

awesome Pro:
* Script-programmable in the Lua programming language. This allows much more control over the WM than by just using casual configuration files.
* Optional DBUS integration. This is important if the WM is to be used as the basis for a fully-featured Desktop Environment, where components frequently communicate with each other using DBUS.
* In contrary to dwm, provides a configuration file. No need to customize a header file in order to hardcode a particular customization.
* Although awesome, like dwm, does not provide a real application launcher, at least does provide a rudimentary popup menu where some fixed menu entries from the configuration files can be selected. In "dwm", a similar functionality can only be achived using keyboard sequences.

awesome Contra:
* The tiling does not work well with popular application such as "Mozilla Firefox" or "The Gimp". For those. special settings have to be provided in the configuration file. This is not very versatile, and it also introduces "special behavior" of the WM for those applications.
* Like dwm, awesome does not have an integrated application launcher. However, dwm's application launcher companion application "dmenu" could be used for awesome as well, although not without some "programming around" for getting a list of possible menu entries. However, jwm has this functionality built-in, and has a smaller installation size than the combination of awesome and dmenu.
* Slightly larger installation size than dwm, but still somewhat smaller as a fully configured "jwm". However, if full documentation for the Lua interface is installed, it is much larger than a dwm or jwm installation.
* The default keyboard/mouse configuration is based on the Mod4 modifier key. While this eliminates most troubles with conflicting application keyboard sequences from which dwm suffers, it requires additional keys such as the "Windows" keys which are not found on every keyboard layout (especially not on the older "classic" QWERTZ or QWERTY layouts). Even though mapping the "Caps Lock" key as Mod4 instead is possible (via command "xmodmap -e 'clear lock' -e 'add mod4 = Caps_Lock'") on most keyboards, it will then take away the normal functionality of the "Caps Lock" key.
* Even though it is most likely considered a feature that awesome can be programmed in the Lua programming language, the downside of this is that awesome's configuration file is actually a Lua program scripts which are executed in order to set the various settings as Lua variables. And this script does not just assign simple values to variables; it also makes use of advanced features of Lua such as loops and lambda function definitions.
This requires users who want to customize awesome to learn the Lua programming language to at least some extent. Even though the basics of the Lua programming language can be learned quite easily, still much more knowledge is required for this than for editing standard UNIX configuration files. Also, learning a programming language, no matter how simple, will always provide some sort mental barrier for many users, including a certain percentage of system administrators. Many software developers might embrace awesome configuration, but other users or administrators most likely won't.

Xfce4 Pro:
* Very feature-rich but still a small DTE. It certainly does not beat KDE or GNOME, but otherwise beats all the other lightweight DTEs in most regards I have tested so far.
* Compared to LXDE, it is less buggy (especial the Xfce panel is very stable compared to lxpanel, at least when I last tested it around 2010) and more powerful.
* Provides dynamic workspaces to be added on the fly when required. The last workspace in the list can also be removed at any time.
* The Task list can optionally combine multiple windows from the same application into a single entry representing a popup-menu. Several different sorting criteria for the popup-menu entries can be selected.
* There are three primary means of selecting/switching applications: A "task list"-toolbar in the panel, a "list of windows"-popup menu and an "Alt-Tab"-triggered preview window. Only the "Alt-Tab"-Feature is always present, the "list of windows" and "task list"-toolbar are actual plug-ins of the panel. All three means provide several criteria which windows to display or rather hide. Such criteria might be whether to include the windows from all workspaces or only the ones from the current workspace. Or whether minimized windows are hidden from selection.
* The Xfce panel has a powerful plug-in system and a rather large number of plugins are available, although still not as much as for KDE or GNOME.
* The Xfce panel is very powerful and stable. It hardly ever crashes and is certainly far less buggy than the LXDE, KDE or GNOME panels (last tested 2010/2011).
* In contrary to most other lightweight DTEs, most things in Xfce4 can actually be configured by means of the Xfce user interface itself without a need for external helper applications. Xfce4 provided a feature-rich "Settings"-application for this purpose similar to the Windows "control panel" application. The various configuration dialogs of this application can also be directly selected via the Xfce menu "Settings"-submenu.
* Xfce supports xscreensaver out of the box, so there is no need to install another fat application like the GNOME screensaver for that purpose.
* In contrary to LXDE, Xfce4 components make use of a set of common framework libraries. This leads to a more consistent look-and-feel across the various configuration dialogs of the various components. It also saves space if many components are installed which all use the same framework libraries, although LXDE is certainly smaller in minimalistic configurations. There are also external applications like the "Parole" media player which make use of the Xfce4 framework libraries, allowing them to share Xfce4's look and feel and also to avoid a lot of code duplication.
* Xfce4 provides its own settings daemon and session manager. Which means gconf or dconf are normally not used by Xfce-applications, although some of them optionally use dbus.
* Xfce4 is based on the GTK+ framework and makes use of the GTK+ "theming" features. Which means GTK+ applications usually cooperate nicely with the selected Xfce4 themes. Qt4-based applications usually integrate also fine with the themes.
* Xfce4 provides its own file manager named "Thunar" which is roughly comparable in power to LXDE's pcmanfm. It lacks some of pcmanfm's features such as tabs, but adds other features in exchange. It has a nice and clean looks and is not overcrowded with features. I personally find pcmanfm a bit more intriguing (especially taking into account its smaller code size), but Thunar is perfectly usable as well.
* Global shortcuts for application launching as well as for the WM are predefined and can freely be modified using a GUI dialog.
* Xfce4 adheres to the xfreedesktop.org standards for automatic creation of menu entries from installed .desktop files, including the possibility to override global .desktop files with used-modified replacements. This means a dedicated menu editor for Xfce is not required; any standards-compliant .desktop file editor like alacarte can be used instead. Or just copy the original .desktop files over and modify them using any text editor. In cases where the choices made by the automatic menu entry assemble process seem inadequate, the default overall menu structure can be modified using customized XML files. For instance, the default Xfce menu structure consinsts only of a single level of submenus below the main menu. Using XML files, applications can be further divided into submenus based on information present in the .desktop files. It can also be used to hardcode the relative order for specific predefined .desktop files or even define new entries completely from scratch.
* Xfce4 has its own screenshot utility, which can also be mapped to the "PrtScrn" key using Xfce4's global keyboard shortcut features.

Xfce4 Contra:
* In comparison to LXDE's pcmanfm and GNOME's Nautilus, Xfce4's Thunar lacks tabbed windows. It follows strictly the MDI metaphor and neither provides Nautilus' two-pane split view mode of two different directories in the same window. However, Xfce4's dynamic workspaces can be used to emulate such MDI features to some extent. But this is also true for GIMP and has been one of GIMP's most critisized design decisions for many years. I too prefer the MDI approach over SDI in multiple workspaces. In my option, workspaces should not be used as a crutch to add missing MDI features missing in an application by external means. Workspaces should group applications, not different windows of the same application. Both would be possible of workspaces were allowed to be hierarchically structured, but I do not know any window manager which supports this. And even if such WMs should exist elsewhere, the Xfce4 WM certainly does not support such a feature.
* Thunar has an annoying bug that it sometimes cannot delete a single folder from within an outer folder containing nothing else than that single nested folder. This is not always the case but if it is, the folder and its contents can only be deleted by alternative means such as reverting to shell commands or using a different file manager.
