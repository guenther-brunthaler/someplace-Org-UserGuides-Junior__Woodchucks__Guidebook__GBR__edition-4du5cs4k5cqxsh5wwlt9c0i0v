If you are using vncviewer to remotely operate a Linux terminal console over the network, you might consider switching off cursor blinking in order to save traffic volume.

Try this first:

$ echo 0 > /sys/devices/virtual/graphics/fbcon/cursor_blink

This assumes the console is using a frame buffer device. It if just uses the VGA character mode, try this:

$ printf '\033[?17;0;127c' # Keyboard troubles? "["="\133" "?"="\077", ";"="\073".

This will switch to a non-blinking block cursor.

Here is avariant with fewer problematic special characters, although it outputs the useless (but harmless) string "000" at the beginning of the line:

$ printf %s GAYD AG23 H4YT OOZQ HMYT EN3D | cksum
4164992930 24
$ printf %s GAYD AG23 H4YT OOZQ HMYT EN3D | base32 -d

When using a keyboard with a German layout with an English keyboard translation table loaded, the "`|`" character can be entered by pressing [Shift]+[#].

Here is a script which worked with the QEMU monitor for sending the sequence as key presses into a VM (with unix-domain socket for the monitor named "./monitor"):

cat > qemu_vm_stop_blinking << '====='
#! /bin/sh
echo "printf %s GAYD AG23 H4YT OOZQ HMYT EN3D | base32 -d" \
| qemu-monitor_sendkey-commands_from_text-lines \
| pv -qL300 \
| socat -u STDIN unix:monitor
=====
chmod +x qemu_vm_stop_blinking

I have not yet found a way to switch to a non-blinking underscore-cursor.

Additional information:

There is a standard control sequence to turn off cursor blinking on terminals.

$ printf '\033[?12l'

But it rarely if ever works, so better forget it.
