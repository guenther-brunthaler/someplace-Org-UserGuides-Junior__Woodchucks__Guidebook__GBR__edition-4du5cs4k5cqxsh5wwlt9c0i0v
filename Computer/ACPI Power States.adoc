Global states G<n>. Processor states (CPU power states) C<n> are intermixed as they seem to be related. Additional C-states are defined by manufacturers for some processors.

* G0.S0: Working. "Awaymode" is a subset of S0, where monitor is off but background tasks are running.
* C0: is the operating state.
* G1, Sleeping. Divided into four states, S1 through S4:
* G1.S1: All the processor caches are flushed, and the CPU(s) stops executing instructions. The power to the CPU(s) and RAM is maintained. Devices that do not indicate they must remain on, may be powered off.
* C1: (often known as Halt) is a state where the processor is not executing instructions, but can return to an executing state essentially instantaneously. C1E is a proprietary extension of C1.
* G1.S2: CPU powered off. Dirty cache is flushed to RAM.
* C2: (often known as Stop-Clock) is a state where the processor maintains all software-visible state, but may take longer to wake up. This state is optional.
* G1.S3: Commonly referred to as Standby, Sleep, or Suspend to RAM (STR). RAM remains powered.
* C3: (often known as Sleep) is a state where the processor does not need to keep its cache coherent, but maintains other state. Some processors have variations on the C3 state (Deep Sleep, Deeper Sleep, etc.) that differ in how long it takes to wake the processor. This state is optional.
* G1.S4: Hibernation or Suspend to Disk. All content of the main memory is saved to non-volatile memory such as a hard drive, and is powered down.
* G2.S5: Soft Off. This is almost the same as G3 Mechanical Off, except that the power supply unit (PSU) still supplies power, at a minimum, to the power button to allow return to S0. A full reboot is required. No previous content is retained. Other components may remain powered so the computer can "wake" on input from the keyboard, clock, modem, LAN, or USB device.
* G3: Mechanical Off. The computer's power has been totally removed via a mechanical switch (as on the rear of a PSU). The power cord can be removed and the system is safe for disassembly (typically, only the real-time clock continues to run - using its own small battery).

There also exist P states for "Performance" and D states for "Device". In all cases, lower number mean more power requirement and better performance.
