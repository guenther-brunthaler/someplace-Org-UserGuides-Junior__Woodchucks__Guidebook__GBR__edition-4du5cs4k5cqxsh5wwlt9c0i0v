Autofill: Has only a single list and no "profiles". This actually makes it easier to use, except for 2 problems: The rule-creation wizard only sees field names, not field labels. And it immediately starts to fill out a form. This is dangeraous because Scripts could send the values automatically "home" before the user has a chance to submit let alone review the form.
Autofill Forms: Better Support for field names. It is possible to postpone automatic filling-in until the user gives the command.
