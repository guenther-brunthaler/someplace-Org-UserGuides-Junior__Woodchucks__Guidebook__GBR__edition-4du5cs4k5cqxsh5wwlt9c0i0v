QR-Code from clipboard contents
===============================
v2020.177


Medium amounts of text
----------------------

Use for things like a shopping list or full length URLs.

----
$ xclip -o -selection clipboard | qrencode -r /dev/stdin -o - -t PNG | display -
----

will display the QR-code as a bitmapped image in a window.

If necessary, the code can be made larger by adding `-s N` where `N` is a pixel count.


Very small amounts of text
--------------------------

Use for things like very short URLs and passwords.

----
$ xclip -o -selection clipboard | qrencode -r /dev/stdin -o - -t ANSI
----

will display the QR-code directly within the terminal window.


Small amounts of text
---------------------

Use for things like rather short URLs and longer passwords.

----
$ xclip -o -selection clipboard | qrencode -r /dev/stdin -o - -t UTF8
----

Also displays the QR-code directly within the terminal windows, but uses quarter-character block graphics. This effectively doubles the available display width and height for the code.

Requires UTF-8 support in the terminal and a font which contains the quarter-character block graphics.
