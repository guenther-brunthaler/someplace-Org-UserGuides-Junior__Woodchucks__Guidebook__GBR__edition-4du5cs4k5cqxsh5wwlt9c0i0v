Tails
=====

Tails is a privacy-centric Linux distribution.

It uses a GNOME desktop and is therefore very ressource-hogging, shitty to use and ugly.

However, it does not access any accessible block devices (other than its own boot medium) by default and has NTFS write support.

But it sucks at being remote operated, featuring not even an SSH server. Ob the other hand, this is probably intentional.

Busybox and netcat are provided though, so one may invoke an unencrypted reverse shell with some effort.
