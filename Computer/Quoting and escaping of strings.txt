Quoting of text strings
=======================


POSIX shell
-----------

* Quoting is used to remove the special meaning of certain characters or words to the shell, such as operators, whitespace, or keywords. There are three types of quoting: matched single quotes, matched double quotes, and backslash.

* Backslash preserves the literal meaning of the following character, with the exception of ⟨newline⟩. A backslash preceding a ⟨newline⟩ is treated as a line continuation.

* Single Quotes enclose text strings in order to preserves the literal meaning of all the characters (except single quotes, making it impossible to put single-quotes in a single-quoted string).

* Double Quotes enclose text strings in order to preserve the literal meaning of all characters except dollarsign ($), backquote (`), and backslash (\). The backslash inside double quotes is historically weird, and serves to quote only the following characters: $ ` " \ <newline>. Otherwise it remains literal.


socat
-----

Within arguments to socat source or destination specifications, the following characters need to be escaped by prefixing them with a backslash:

* ":"
* ","

This applies escpecially to the "EXEC:" specification. Note that literal spaces do not need to be escaped in socat (but the shell will require quoting of the socat arguments themselves).
