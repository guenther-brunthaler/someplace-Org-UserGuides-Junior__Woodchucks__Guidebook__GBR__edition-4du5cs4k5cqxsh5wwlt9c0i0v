"Magic" SysRq key
=================
v2025.175

The key itself is labeled differently depending on the keyboard layout.

* On English layouts, it is normally labeled [SysRq] ("System Request")
* On German layouts, it is normally labeled [S-Abf] ("System-Abfrage")


Safest possible enforced reboot
-------------------------------

While holding [Alt]+[SysRq] pressed down, press the following sequence of additional keys: [r], [s], [e], [i], [s], [u], [s], [b].

In short: rseisusb. Mnemonic: "r-seis-usb".

This syncs multiple times, in case some of the other steps produce new unwritten data in the caches.


Safest possible enforced power-off
----------------------------------

Same as for reboot, but replace the "B" with a "O" (the letter Oh, not the digit Zero).

In short: rseisusb. Mnemonic: "r-seis-uso".


Individual key functions
------------------------

Press the combination [Alt]+[SysRq]+[command key] in order to trigger a special function, with "command key" being one of the following:

'r'     - Turns off keyboard raw mode and sets it to XLATE.

'k'     - Secure Access Key (SAK) Kills all programs on the current virtual
          console. NOTE: See important comments below in SAK section.

'b'     - Will immediately reboot the system without syncing or unmounting
          your disks.

'c'     - Will perform a kexec reboot in order to take a crashdump.

'o'     - Will shut your system off (if configured and supported).

's'     - Will attempt to sync all mounted filesystems.

'u'     - Will attempt to remount all mounted filesystems read-only.

'p'     - Will dump the current registers and flags to your console.

't'     - Will dump a list of current tasks and their information to your
          console.

'm'     - Will dump current memory info to your console.

'v'     - Dumps Voyager SMP processor info to your console.

'0'-'9' - Sets the console log level, controlling which kernel messages
          will be printed to your console. ('0', for example would make
          it so that only emergency messages like PANICs or OOPSes would
          make it to your console.)

'f'     - Will call oom_kill to kill a memory hog process

'e'     - Send a SIGTERM to all processes, except for init.

'i'     - Send a SIGKILL to all processes, except for init.

'l'     - Send a SIGKILL to all processes, INCLUDING init. (Your system
          will be non-functional after this.)

'h'     - Will display help ( actually any other key than those listed
          above will display help. but 'h' is easy to remember :-)

re'B'oot is good when you're unable to shut down. But you should also 'S'ync
and 'U'mount first.

Trigger SysRq-actions programmatically:

$ echo $letter > /proc/sysrq-trigger
$ dmesg

Some keyboards do not support the above key combinations. In those cases, use the keyboard sequence [Alt]+[SysRq], [Alt]+[SysRq]+[command key] instead.

It is also possible to send the commands via a serial console connection, if one has been set up before. In this case, send a BREAK, followed by the command character within 5 seconds. In order to send a normal BREAK, send it twice on order to be interpreted as a single regular BREAK.
