A structure for constant databases
==================================
D. J. Bernstein


Classical "cdb" format
----------------------

A cdb is an associative array: it maps strings (`keys`) to strings (`data`).

A cdb contains 256 pointers to linearly probed open hash tables. The hash tables contain pointers to (key,data) pairs. A cdb is stored in a single file on disk:

|====
| p0 p1 ... p255 | records | hash0 | hash1 | ... | hash255
|====

Each of the 256 initial pointers states a position and a length. The position is the starting byte position of the hash table. The length is the number of slots in the hash table.

Records are stored sequentially, without special alignment. A record states a key length, a data length, the key, and the data.

Each hash table slot states a hash value and a byte position. If the byte position is 0, the slot is empty. Otherwise, the slot points to a record whose key has that hash value.

Positions, lengths, and hash values are 32-bit quantities, stored in little-endian form in 4 bytes. Thus a cdb must fit into 4 gigabytes.

A record is located as follows. Compute the hash value of the key in the record. The hash value modulo 256 is the number of a hash table. The hash value divided by 256, modulo the length of that table, is a slot number. Probe that slot, the next higher slot, and so on, until you find the record or run into an empty slot.

The cdb hash function is `h = ((h << 5) + h) ^ c`, with a starting hash of '5381'.

Further notes (not from upstream):

* Hash tables shall be enlarged once half if its buckets have become in use.

* Linear probing for a key wraps around to the first bucket when encountering the end of a hash table.

* Supposedly the reason for the 2-level approach is the idea of creating every secondary hash table in memory individually and then flushing them out to the cdb file, re-using the memory for the next hash table after this.


cdb64 format
------------

Seems to be the same as the classical format, except that all values are stored as 8-byte 64-bit quantities.

Theoretically this would allow databases up to 16 EiB in size, but currently existing implementation code limits the database size to 1 EiB.
