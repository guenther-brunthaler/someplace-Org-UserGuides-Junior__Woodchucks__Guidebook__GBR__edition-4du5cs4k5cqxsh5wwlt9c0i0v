yEnc
====
v2023.236

yEnc ("why encode?") is a binary-to-text encoding which requires an 8-bit clean transport channel.

Its overhead is small, typically 2 %.

The downside is that many of the ASCII control characters may occur in the output, which is not compatible with the e-mail or MIME standards.

yEnc is heavily used in UseNet binary groups.


Encoding procedure
------------------

Input byte `inp`, output byte `outp`:

----
outp := (inp + 42) mod 256
If outp is_member_of [NUL, LF, CR, optionally(HT), "="]:
	outp := "=" && (inp + 64)
----

where

* `&&` is string concatenation and

* `optionally(x)` means `x` may be omitted from the set.
