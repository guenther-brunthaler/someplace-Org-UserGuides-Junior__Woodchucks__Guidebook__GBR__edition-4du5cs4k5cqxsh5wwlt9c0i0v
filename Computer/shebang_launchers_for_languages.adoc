Shell-based script launchers for various languages
==================================================

This document contains different methods I found or have designed myself for launching scripts written in different programming languages from within a shell script embedding the actual scripts to be run.

Most of the languages are scripting languages, but some are compiles languages. In this case, a temporary executable will be built in a temporary directory, then been run there, and be deleted afterwards.


TinyScheme
----------

I created a fork of TinyScheme named `tinyscheme-trch55q0vtb6hxzlr0hgcnjpb` because I had to fix a few deficiencies. (The name suffix is just a base-35 encoded UUID, making sure the patched version cannot be mistaken for the original upstream version.)

I decided to use semantic versioning, starting as usual with version `1.0` (`1` being the major version). The launcher for this major version is:

----
#! /bin/sh
":"; exec tinyscheme-trch55q0vtb6hxzlr0hgcnjpb-1 -1 "$0" ${1+"$@"}
(do
  ((i 1 (+ i 1)) (a *args* (cdr a))) ((null? a))
  (display "argv[") (display i) (display "] = \"")
  (display (car a)) (display "\"") (newline))
----


Chez/Petite Scheme
------------------

This is the launcher for major version 9.5:

----
#! /bin/sh
":"; exec petite9.5 --script "$0" ${1+"$@"}
(do
  ((i 0 (+ i 1)) (a (command-line) (cdr a))) ((null? a))
  (display "argv[") (display i) (display "] = \"")
  (display (car a)) (display "\"") (newline))
----


== C ==

This is for the installed version of the 'C' language:

----
#! /bin/sh
set -e
cleanup() {
	rc=$?
	test "$TD" && rm -r -- "$TD"
	test $rc = 0 || echo "\"$0\" failed!" >& 2
}
TD=
trap cleanup 0; trap 'exit $?' INT QUIT HUP TERM
bn=${0##*/}
TD=`mktemp -d -- "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/$bn.XXXXXXXXXX"`
run() {
	{
		pfxlen=`sed '/=\{3,\}/ q' "$0" | wc -l`
		pfxlen=`expr $pfxlen + 1`; echo "#line $pfxlen \"$0\""; cat
	} > "$TD/$bn.c"
	(
		cd -- "$TD" && make -f /dev/null -s -- \
			CFLAGS='-D NDEBUG -O' LDFLAGS='-s' "$bn"
	)
	"$TD/$bn" ${1+"$@"}
}
run ${1+"$@"} << '==='

#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
   int i;
   for (i= 0; i < argc; ++i) {
      if (printf("argv[%d] = \"%s\"\n", i, argv[i]) < 0) {
         wr_err: (void)fputs("Write error!\n", stderr);
         return EXIT_FAILURE;
      }
   }
   if (fflush(0)) goto wr_err;
}
